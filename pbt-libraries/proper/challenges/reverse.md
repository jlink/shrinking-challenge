# Report for PropEr Shrinking on "reverse"

This report was generated with PropEr's master branch on 24/8/2020
[commit](https://github.com/proper-testing/proper/commit/8bed46993a3bd908ba9631ee8699071a2c0f0aa0).

## Normalization

PropEr normalises this example to either ``[0,1]``, ``[0,-1]``, ``[-1,0]``, or ``[1,0]``.

## Performance

Over 100 runs, PropEr found a counterexample after 4 to 14 tests
and performed between 0 and 3 shrinking attempts.

See the [report of the run](reverse.report) for more information.
