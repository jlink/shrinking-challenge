# Report for Americium Shrinking on "lengthlist"

This report was generated with Americium 1.5.1

## Normalization

Americium currently uses a fixed internal randomisation seed, so always yields the same shrinkage:

* ``[[900]]`` - casesLimit = 200

## Performance

753 cases were run.

0 successful runs were performed out of a limit of 200 successful cases, prior to the first failing case.

1 + 12 = 13 runs then failed out of a subsequent shrinkage sequence of 753 - 0 = 753 runs, including the first failing case.

The best shrunk case was followed by 753 - 516 = 237 successful cases in the shrinkage sequence.
