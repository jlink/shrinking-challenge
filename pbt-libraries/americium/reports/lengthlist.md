# Report for Americium Shrinking on "lengthlist"

This report was generated with Americium 1.4.6

## Normalization

Americium currently uses a fixed internal randomisation seed, so always yields the same shrinkage:

* ``[[900]]`` - casesLimit = 180

## Performance

725 cases were run.

0 successful runs were performed out of a limit of 180 successful cases, prior to the first failing case.

1 + 14 = 15 runs then failed out of a subsequent shrinkage sequence of 725 - 0 = 725 runs, including the first failing case.

The best shrunk case was followed by 725 - 526 = 199 successful cases in the shrinkage sequence.
