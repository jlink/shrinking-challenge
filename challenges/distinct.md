# Distinct Elements in a List

[Original source](https://github.com/mc-imperial/hypothesis-ecoop-2020-artifact/tree/master/smartcheck-benchmarks/evaluations/distinct)

This tests the example provided for the property "a list of integers containing at least three distinct elements".

This is interesting because:

1. Most property-based testing libraries will not successfully normalize (i.e. always return the same answer) this property, because it requires reordering examples to do so.
2. Hypothesis and test.check both provide a built in generator for "a list of distinct elements", so the "example of size at least N" provides a sort of lower bound for how well they can shrink those built in generators.

The expected smallest falsified sample is `[0, 1, -1]` or `[0, 1, 2]`.
